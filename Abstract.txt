A municipality removes trash from various properties throughout a six-day period. This trash removal service can include residents, restaurants, and retail stores. All of which have different needs. For example, a popular restaurant may need almost daily visits, whereas a resident may need visited once per week. Although this appears to be a simple problem there is oftentimes much optimization to be done. Simply choosing X as the fleet size and driving to the nearest node (drop-off location) leaves much to be desired. Deemed a Periodic Vehicle Routing Problem (PVRP), this issue is usually best optimized by means of computer technology, is generally regarded as NP-complete, and can extend to far more problems than trash removal. Time, distance, and fleet size can all be reduced and preference given (such as smaller fleet size with larger driving distances). In the end this can benefit companies, fleet members, the environment, and more.
